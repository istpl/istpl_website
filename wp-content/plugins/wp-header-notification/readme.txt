Add a Notification bar similar to Google in your blog's header.

== Description == 

Do you need to post some notice on your blog?

With this plugin, you can simply add a Notification Bar to your blog's Header!

You can custom the text of the Notification Bar and the Link & Text of the "See Now!" Button.

There is also a button with "Close" and you can set the re-notice time in option page of the plugin.
